# Detector

This folder contains the CLI, Web Dashboard, the API Server and the intrusion detection. The connection to the Local Storage is also established here. The algorithms folder has the implementation of the algorithms (bosc and STIDE). The static folder has static files such as scripts, CSS files, images, etc... that must be sent to the browser when requested. The templates folder has the html (JINJA templates) necessary to present the dashboard to the user. The file main.py is the entrypoint for the Flask app. Some settings can be found in the config.py file and the classes.py contains structures used to agents and configs. The cli.py allows the user to interact with the tool via a command-line interface and the dashboard.py is a blueprint for the web dashboard. The api.py file corresponds to the API Server (and its endpoints) in the tool's architecture. All the other utility functions can be found in the utils.py file.
